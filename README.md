# FibreWiki
A fork of [McWebServer](https://github.com/J-onasJones/McWebserver) that aims to port [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/) to Fabric.

## About the mod
This mod is going under a complete rewrite, as McWebServer was used as a starting point for this project.\
I'm going in a completely different direction from the original mod, stripping out major parts and replacing others.\
Still very much a WIP, but it's coming along.
